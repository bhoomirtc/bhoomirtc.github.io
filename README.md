Bhoomi-RTC: Karnataka Land Records Tool (One Paragraph)
Bhoomi-RTC is a focused, open-source utility library designed to help researchers and developers interact with and understand the digital land records (RTC/Pahani) data released by the Government of Karnataka, aiming to simplify the otherwise complex process of reading official documents by offering features like structured data parsing to convert raw HTML or PDF extracts into easily manageable JSON format, validation functions to quickly check the accuracy of inputs like Taluk, District, and Survey Numbers against known patterns, and clear internal documentation to map the various components of a typical Record of Rights, Tenancy, and Crops (RTC); to get started, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt, and run one of the provided examples, like python run_parser.py --file your_rtc_data.html, keeping in mind this is a third-party tool and is not officially affiliated with the Government of Karnataka, so the official Bhoomi Portal must always be used for all legal purposes; we encourage contributions through Pull Requests from anyone who finds ways to improve the parsing or add new validation utilities.
